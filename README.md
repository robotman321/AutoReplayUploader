# AutoReplayUploader
BakkesMod plugin that automatically uploads Rocket League replays to other services (calculated.gg, ballchasing.com, carball.pro) when a match ends.

## Description of Source Projects

**AutoReplayUploader:** Contains only the plugin code and anything that has to interact with the Bakkes API.

* NOTE: The project had lots of warnings when compiling in VS2019 build tools. 
  The are silenced for now by adding to ConsoleUploader.vcxproj:
  
  <ClCompile>
  <DisableSpecificWarnings>4251;4244</DisableSpecificWarnings>
  ...
  and:
  <Link>
  <GenerateDebugInformation>False</GenerateDebugInformation>
  ...

  More info about warnings:
    Compiler Warning (level 1) C4251
      -'identifier' : class 'type' needs to have dll-interface to be used by clients of class 'type2'
    Compiler Warning (levels 3 and 4) C4244
      -'conversion' conversion from 'type1' to 'type2', possible loss of data
    Linker Tools Warning LNK4099
      -PDB 'filename' was not found with 'object/library' or at 'path'; linking object as if no debug info


**NOTE2: In order to build, the AutoReplayUploader project has to be updated to add the BakkesMod include directory to the compiler properties as well as adding the folder that contains the bakkesmod.dll to the additional library directory in the linker.*

Bakkesmod folders can be set in:
AutoReplayUploader/AutoReplayUploader/bakkesmod.props

Can be compiled with Visual Studio Build Tools 2019
* Use the Developer PowerShell for VS 2019
